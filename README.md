[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codefellows-seattle-301d9/05-new-article-creation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codefellows-seattle-301d9/05-new-article-creation) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/Issues%3F-Ask%20for%20Help!-orange.svg)](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-301d4/issues/new)

Now's a good time to recap what we've covered so far. Then, we'll build an article creation form for the blog, so authors have a nice way to write new posts.

Follow along with the in-class workshop. When you are done, you should be able to add new articles to the blog.
